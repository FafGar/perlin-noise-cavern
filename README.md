# Perlin Noise Cavern
As the description states, this is a Unity project which creates randomly generated tunnels meant to represent underground tunnels. This was meant to be the base for a game where the player would travel down the tunnels collecting resources, which is where the glowing green crystals come in to things. I eventually realized I didn't have an idea on how to make that fun in an original way, so the work I had already done will wait here until that idea occurs to me. In the meantime, please forgive its rough appearance.

### Running
If you wish to view the project and what it currently does, just open it as a Unity project (It was developed in version 2021.3.24f1) and hit play. The only button which actively does anything is **Left Alt** which move the player capsule forwards through the cavern.
